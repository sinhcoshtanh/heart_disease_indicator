# Introduction

According to the [Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/index.htm) and the [World Health Organisation (WHO)](https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases#tab=tab_1), heart disease is the leading cause of death globally. With a global estimation that 17.9 million lives are lost due to Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) specifically. Furthermore, it is alos known that nearly half of people in [developed countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country) are at high risk in developing heart disease as indicated by believed causes/key indicators for heart disease.

# Data

In this repo and project I will do my best to visualise and potential create correlations between what is considered as 'Personal Key Indicators' (PKIs) and being diseased with heart disease. This dataset was originally recorded from the CDC was apart of the 'Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)' telephone survey. This dataset contains data from approximataely 400,000 adults.

These make up the columns of the data set of record the results as 9 booleans, 5 strings, and 4 floats, having each column as:

- HeartDisease
- BMI
- Smoking
- AlcoholDrinking
- Stroke
- PhysicalHealth
- MentalHealth
- Sex
- AgeCategory
- Race
- Diabetic
- PhysicalActivity
- GenHealth
- SleepTime
- Asthma
- KidneyDisease
- SkinCancer
